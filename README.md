# Teams-Cache-Eater üî™üó°Ô∏è
A couple of simple scripts to clear the cache in a nice clean way.<br>
Does your team-mate's profile picture for you and the world are different??<br>
This is a super simple script, which honestly should be a built in button in Microsoft Teams, since they won't do it, so let's get started!

## Note‚ö†Ô∏è

## Tested Operating Systems
The [Teams_Cache_Eater_MacOS](Teams_Cache_Eater_MacOS.sh) script has been tested on MacOS Monterey 12.0 and 12.2 release.<br>
The [Teams_Cache_Eater_Windows](Teams_Cache_Eater_Windows.bat) script has been tested on Windows 10 releases 1909 to 21H2.<br>
The scripts should work on releases before that too, it's just, I didn't test it.
